Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <p>We may use cookies to distinguish you from other users of Stagedoor and to provide you with a good experience.
      Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of Stagedoor. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close Stagedoor. These are known as session cookies. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to Stagedoor and will last for longer. These are known as persistent cookies.</p>

      <p>To the extent that we use cookies, they shall be used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>remember that you have visited us before so that we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
          </li>
          <li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of Stagedoor; and
          </li>
          <li>collect statistical information about how you use Stagedoor so that we can improve and learn which parts of Stagedoor are most popular to visitors.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p>Cookies may be set by us or may be set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. For example, social networking sites.</p>

      <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. Please note however, that by blocking or deleting cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of Stagedoor if you do so.</p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>

      <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at the contact details set out below in this privacy policy.</p>

      <p>You have the right to access information held about you. Any access request may be subject to a small fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>

      <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you.</p>
